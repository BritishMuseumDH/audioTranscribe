### Transcribing the British Museum's audio archive from SoundCloud

The British Museum has a very active programme of lectures, pod casts and other primarily audio activities.
These have not always been transcribed, and this application will allow us to get this task completed and open up this 
archive to scholarly research, more accessible uses and more serendipitous use that we may not have thought of.

Each SoundCloud episode has been chopped into 10 second chunks, and we would like you to listen to these and attempt to
capture what is being said (and if possible by whom). It is a very simple application!

These pod casts and associated data are provided under a CC-BY-NC-SA licence.
